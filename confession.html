            <p><strong>Dear Shane,</strong></p>
            <p>       Hi shane i know that you dont know me po hihi Ⴚტ◕‿◕ტჂ, but i know you po 
                and ive been admiring you for few months napo. you really caught my attention kasi
                from the very first day of school, you made me turn my back to look at you. 
                You are very pretty and beautiful (-‿◦☀), i admit at first i wasn't sure if i do like u
                but as time goes by na realzie ko na, i do have a crush on you. i like every single 
                thing about you, although we never interacted yet. but i bet that your kind naman po.
            </p>

            <p> Please dont be pressured on this confession (o・┏ω┓・o). as this was my only way po kasi
                to finally tell what i feel, and have my peace of mind.  I’m not expecting anything po in return. I just wanted to be honest with myself and share this with you. Kahit na we don’t know each other yet, I’ll continue to admire you from afar  
                and cheer for you in my own quiet way (◡‿◡✿).<p>
            
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wishing you all the best po, Shane! Sana po you'll keep being amazing. If ever you’d like to know me  
                    better or have a chat, I’d be so happy to get the chance, but no pressure talaga (´｡• ᵕ •｡`).  
                </p>
                
                <p>Take care always po! (✿◠‿◠)<br>
